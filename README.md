- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZaCooke
- 👀 I’m interested in learning enough Github, coding, and development principles to better communicate with technical team members, and to build hobbyist projects myself.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning my way through all the Brilliant CS courses, a spread of Github tutorials, Vercel and other AI tools... honestly, I'm all over the map!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that aligns between my and others' interests. Whether that's in business or just for learning, I'm there.
- 📫 How to reach me is flexible - but if there's a Github message feature, let's start there.
